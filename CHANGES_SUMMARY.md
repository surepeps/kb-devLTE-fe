# Changes Made

## 1. ✅ Removed Land Size and Measurement Unit from Rent Properties

### Preference Page Changes:
- **File**: `src/components/preference-form/PropertyDetails.tsx`
- **Change**: Completely removed the optional land size and measurement unit fields for rent properties
- **Impact**: Rent properties no longer show land size or measurement unit fields in the preference form

### Post Property Page Changes:
- **File**: `src/components/post-property-components/forms/RentPropertyForm.tsx`
  - Removed land size and measurement type requirements from validation
  - Removed landSize object from the API payload

- **File**: `src/components/post-property-components/forms/update/UpdateRentPropertyForm.tsx`
  - Removed land size and measurement type requirements from validation
  - Removed landSize object from the update API payload

### Note: 
The rent step components (`RentStep1BasicDetails.tsx`, `RentStep2FeaturesConditions.tsx`) already did NOT include land size fields, so no changes were needed there.

## 2. ✅ Changed Image Upload Minimum from 4 to 1

### Context Changes:
- **File**: `src/context/post-property-context.tsx`
- **Change**: Changed `getMinimumRequiredImages()` from returning `4` to returning `1`
- **Impact**: Property posting now requires minimum 1 image instead of 4

### Image Upload Component Changes:
- **File**: `src/components/post-property-components/Step3ImageUpload.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated initialization logic to respect the new minimum requirement
  - Updated empty slot creation logic to use `getMinimumRequiredImages()`
  - Still shows 4 empty slots initially for better UX, but only requires 1 image to proceed

## Testing Recommendations

### For Task 1 (Land Size Removal):
1. Navigate to `/preference` and select "Rent Property"
2. Go through the form steps - verify that land size and measurement unit fields are completely absent
3. Navigate to `/post-property/rent` and verify no land size fields appear
4. Test form submission to ensure it works without land size data

### For Task 2 (Image Minimum Change):
1. Navigate to `/post-property/rent` (or any property type)
2. Go to Step 3 (Image Upload)
3. Upload only 1 image and verify you can proceed to the next step
4. Check that the counter shows "1 of 1 minimum images uploaded" (instead of "1 of 4")
